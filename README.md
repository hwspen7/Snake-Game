# Snake-Game

## Overview

A classic Snake game build with TypeScript, Webpack, and SCSS, focusing on clean modular structure, basic game loop design, and DOM-based rendering. This project implements a browser-based Snake game using a simple grid system and demonstrates hhow to organize a small front-end application with TypeScript modules, handle user input, and manage game state in a structured and maintainable way.

## Features

* Keyboard-controlled snake movement
* Randomized food generation on a grid
* Score and level system with speed scaling
* Dynamic snake body growth
* Collision detection (walls and self)

## Tech Stack

* TypeScript
* Webpack 5
* SCSS (Sass)
* HTML + DOM API
